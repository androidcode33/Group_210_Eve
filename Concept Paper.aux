\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{\textmd  {Computer vision is an interdisciplinary field that deals with how computers can be made for gaining high-level understanding from digital images or videos. From the perspective of science and engineering, it pursues to automate tasks that the human visual system can fix.\cite  {DUMMY:4} And in the Sub-domains of computer vision in relation to security include; scene reconstruction, event detection, video tracking, object recognition, object pose estimation, motion estimation, and image restoration among others.\\ Physical security is often a second thought when it comes to information security and since physical security has technical and administrative elements, it is oftenly overlooked because most organizations focus on “technology-oriented security countermeasures” \cite  {DUMMY:2} to prevent hacking attacks. The computer vision system will be designed for the protection of personnel, hardware, software, networks and data from physical actions and events that could cause serious loss or damage to an enterprise or company.}}{1}}

\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{\textmd  {Computer vision as a discipline that has made a significant impact on a number of diverse application domains eg \cite  {DUMMY:1} and it has been around since the 1960s.\\ Beginning from the seventies through the nineties, computer vision started proving its practical value in a wide range of diverse application domains including medical diagnostics,manufacturing, environmental monitoring, space exploration, and military systems such as automatic target recognition, precision weapons, reconnaissance\cite  {DUMMY:3} and currently its at an extraordinary point in its development.\\Physical security over the past decades has become increasingly more difficult for organizations. Technology and computer environments now allow more compromises to occur due to increased vulnerabilities. USB hard drives, laptops, tablets and smartphones allow for information to be lost or stolen because of portability and mobile access. In the early days of computers, they were large mainframe computers only used by a few people and were secured in locked rooms \cite  {DUMMY:2}. Today, desks are filled with desktop computers and mobile laptops that have access to company data from across the enterprise. Protecting data, networks and systems has become difficult to implement with mobile users being able to take their computers out of the facilities. Fraud, vandalism, sabotage, accidents, and theft are increasing costs for organizations since the environments are becoming more “complex and dynamic” \cite  {DUMMY:2}.}}{1}}
